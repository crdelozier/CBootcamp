UPenn C Programming Bootcamp
=========

* Before the bootcamp, please ensure that you have access to the resources listed below on your 
  laptop.  All resources are available via ssh on eniac.seas.upenn.edu.  For instructions on how
  to connect to eniac, please see these directions (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/cets/answers/remote.html).
  + C compiler - Demonstrations during the bootcamp will use the gcc compiler.  This compiler is available
    via the command line on the eniac server.  gcc is included with most Linux distributions and is 
    available to Mac OS X users in the developer tools package (included with Xcode).  Windows users 
    can either use gcc on the server via ssh or download a package such as MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/).
  + Text editor - For students connecting to eniac via ssh, the nano text editor will be available for 
    use.  Students are also welcome to use more advanced editors such as emacs and vi if they are 
    comfortable with these editors.  If you are editing code directly on your laptop, ensure that you 
    have access to a text editor such as Notepad.
  + Source code examples - Students should download this repository to the machine that they plan to 
    use for the bootcamp.  If you are working on eniac, you can download the source files using the 
    command "git clone https://github.com/crdelozier/CBootcamp.git".
